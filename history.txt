    The example includes key/value pairs and upload files
  - POST {{HostAddress}}/multiProcess
    An example that trigger multi-processing of pdf2image worker.
    This add 4 jobs that 4 x pdf2image jobs are running in parallel
    Result: No noticeable improvement that multi-processing has better performance than multi-threading

  Try to test if the performance is the same as multiple workers which each one has its own queue
  Result: same performance
